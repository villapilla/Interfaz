# Sample JavaScript Project #

## Description ##

This project shows the use of the following tools:

* grunt as the task runner
* mocha as the test framework
* chai as the assertion library
* less as the css preprocessor
* Markdown to html converter

It works both in Node.js and the browser. A bunch of tools can be used
to write code that works in both execution environments, for instance:

* RequireJS
* browserify

## Setup ##

To set this up:

```bash
$ npm install
$ grunt```

Remember that the uglified code is generated under the lib directory

Enjoy!
